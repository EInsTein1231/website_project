<p id="L1">Do you want to become a website developer? Well, today we are going through web development in a nutshell. 
</p><br>

<p>Web development is basically divided into two major sections : the front end and the back end. Also known as the client side and the server side.

<p>The front end web development focuses on the client side where the developers work with graphic designers or UI/UX designers to create the layout, content and experience of the website.
The development team comprises the web content developer, server scriptor and the network security developer. 
</p><br>

<h3 id="L2">The difference between front end and back end developers</h3><br>

<p>
In the world of software engineering, there are those specialised at front end, back end and those that are good at both, known as full stack developers a.k.a "Superman". 
</p><br>

<p>
But this brings up the questions, what is front end and back end? Firstly, web development is the process of building websites, which is different from UI UX which focuses more on the design, web development is on the website functions.
</p><br>


<p><b>Front End Development  <b></p><br>
<p>
Front end developers program with the user in mind. Front end is a style of computer programming that focus on creating the elements and features of a website that will nbe seen by the user. You can also think of front
Front end development is the programming which creates the features that is visible by the user. This is also known as the client side. 
</p><br>

<p>
They will use knowledge about human psychology to create aesthetics and designs with colours to create high quality user experience. These can be translated through the elements such as buttons, navigation bar, layouts, graphics, images, animation and the structure of content. 
</p><br>

<p><b>Back End Development <b></p><br>
<p>
Back end development  focuses on the development on the site's performance and interactiveness, known as the server side. For example, a social media website has a lot of data, and to update and keep the data secured and easily accessible by the user, there has to be a place where its all accessible. This is called the database, or storage center and the back end developer is to code the connection that links the database with the website. Apart from that, they also work on troubleshooting, debugging and database management.
</p><br>


<p>
So in summary, the difference between front end dev and back end, is 
front end focuses on the visual elements such as the buttons, designs, colors and layout of the website, while the back end works on the performance and interactive aspects of the website. Together, they create a dynamic website.
</p><br>

<p><b>Examples of dynamic websites:  <b></p><br>
<p>
<br>1. Instagram: a social media website which relies on user generated content as the feed that the user sees. <br>
<br>2. YouTube: a video media website and application which relies on creators to create content to be on the viewers feed <br>
<br>3. Google: A search engine which uses user created websites and applications to be used by the public.<br>

<h3 id="L3">Process of creating a website : </h3><br>
<p>
<br>1. Buy your domain name 
<br>2. Register domain name with the same hosting company 
<br>3. design and launch your website
</p><br>

<p>
1. Buy your domain name 
To create your own website, you would need a domain name to allow your customers / clients or viewers to type in the name of your website and visit it. Its important to choose a domain name and URL that is easily remembered. Once you have decided on your domain name, choose a domain name extension ( .com / .au / .edu / .gov ) depending on your company service, location and purpose. A domain name normally costs $10-$20 per year for .com, and more as shown here : 
</p><br>

<p>
Note that you have to choose to buy your domain name and extension with a renewal term of 1,3,5, or 10 years. After choosing your domain name and extension, you will have an option to create a personal email for the website / company. ( e.g. nikebusiness@email.com ) 
</p><br>

<p>
2. Register domain name with the same hosting company 
For the website to be seen and accessed in the internet, you need a web hosting company to provide you a space in their server to host your website. Normally you follow the company that you chose your domain name from to host your website for convenience. 
</p><br>

<p>
Web hosting companies offer different services to support your website,

</p><br>

<p>
3. Create and design your website, once done launch it. If you have already coded your website or plan on coding, then you just have to create your space, add your file, preview then launch your website. If you want to use the prebuilt or use the hosting company's website creator software to make your website is also possible.
