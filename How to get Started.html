<b>How to get started ? </b><br>

<br>

<br>Content: 
<br><b>Step 1. </b>Identify your goal with programming, what do you want to do? 

<br>

<br><b>Step 2.</b> With this goal (no.1 answer), you would need to <br>learn different languages for the programming of that. 
<br>
<br>(a) Mechanical engineering - Python, C++,  
<br>(b) Website - HTML5, JS, CSS, React.JS 
<br>(c) Data Science - Python, Numpy
<br>(d) Machine Learning - Python, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Go 

<br>

<br><b>Step 3. </b>Start learning. Remember, there is no use trying <br>to think about something. Get started, even if its <br>plannning how to get started. Get started. Remember <br>thinking is useless, planning is better. Set a goal and start.

One page for all links, 
Can we focus on one single website first? 
Now that we know how to make websites, can we start with React JS? 
We made our first interactive website 
Now we created the place to put our things, so we need to focus on creating the various different little things that we want our website, the ADAM LIM HAN JUNG page to look like so find the following : 
- websites / portfolios that are similar to what you want to do. 
Continue studying the Javascript in the HTML Javascript then you can start with the creation of better movement, 
Use some images that are free first to look at the finished draft, then edit to the final one with the designs that you create yourself. 
Start with the software engineering page, copywriting to take notes on what you learned or skip to step React JS. 
After that, create the portfolio using React JS. 
Declutter your space in the folders, add the links into the website. 
Find a topic that you are immensely passionate about and go through the hard work of learning techniques and turn it into real work that people can take away in seconds for a price. 
Save some digital art on pinterest and on ipad to refer to when drawing so you can practise. 

Lets create a website that talks all about the topic Financial Freedom / Becoming Rich
TOpics to write on 
- book summaries 
- Taxes
- Real estate 
- Financial literacy 
- assets 
- Growth mindset. 
- 



LEts use the money to open a shopify store + advertisement 
To do : 
How can we find high quality cloth or manufacturers ? 
We are solving the 


I think no matter what or where you go, what really matters is actually the fact that you just want a team to train with. 
Going overseas might damage that still because of how expensive it is. but taking into account the people 
Staying here is also important because we are talking about you happiness. 

Internship time should focus on trying out as many things as possible, like your own youtube dance channel, teaching people how to dance? And TikTok videos. I want to own a dance studio where I can film alot of videos there, and work there, different background. Styles, editing, clothing sponsorships. Create advertising videos to start a youtube movie related company. 

Create advertising for my clothing business. 

Step 1 : who has potential, do you have potential in this field. THen step 2 : who can grow 

THE TIHNG i WANT you to choose between is running or swimming and go all out in it. You can still train runnint or swimming as training, but choose which one you want to go all in with. Which one are you passionate about. Swimming Of course. So my question now is what are you going to do to become the Olympian , have fun in training. Where are you going to go to ? 

TO DO :
1. Study for Comp Org exam this wednesday (tomorrow)
2. Study for Math final Exam next Friday 
3. Decide how much training per day is needed instead of just 1 hour 
4. Join Swimming club training at least 2 times a week. 


Thoughts 
- I think we should think everyday as brand new day instead of monday or sunday. rather each day as the same thing. 
- chase after your dreams. Follow your dreams. Dont ever give up. There are other people chasing theirs as well. I really want to become an Olympian, so I will work very hard to achieve that. 
- remember that they also need to travel there and spend the money, they drive there my friend. Some take train as its near. 
- I want to give people goosebumps when I perform as well, to entrance people with my work. 


Inspiration on Dream

WHat I learnt from NIZI project : 
- Its my life. 
- Put in more effort. 
- Every month evaluate yourself. And receive critical feedback.
- JOIN THE CLUB - never stop going. YES, be patient. 
- Do plank and sit ups everyday. Everytime Strong core is what keeps everything together. Do it as warm up. 
- You only get nervous when you dont work hard. 
- dont be an amateur but a professional athlete. 
- How to crazy fitness levels. Levels of fitness to those of the legends. Like really fit kind of people I want to become like that. 
- I already know that you can do that, so try something different and more control. - show the sprint in the beginning instead of the end. 

I have 5 months to train alone. After that its all in a team. All is near you house and you can drive there or go to work on the way. Right now, cant because of studies and its too far. 


I still rememebr the 400m I sprinted. 
- The first 50 was really fast. Same like running 
- They slowly drew away from me, same like running. 
- Basically its also not easy pace for them, they are also sprinting. 
- SO in conclusion, what you need to do is actually the sprinting of the event if its long, and do it really well. Sprint more of the 200m, 


- Need to kick lots. How? 
- its an everyday thing like nature. We dont really think much, we just do it, like its our nature.


DESIGN FOR WEBSITE 
- I want to draw or make it personal. 
- adding personal handwriting X typing format as logo, or parts of the website. Make creative with NMIXX colourful theme, similar. 



Training Studies 
- It's all about sustainability. Whether your training is sustainable for your body. 
- could be 2 x 2 hours in the pool, 1 hour of gym, 1 hour of yoga and stretching, 
- things like dancing can be done longer because it has lesser strain on the body, however, the running and swimming is physically demanding and speed and strenghth and endurance is a factor, cant be done too much. 
- swimming is all about putting in your maximum effort, energy in a specific time. 
Dancing is all about 


Daiya seto.
- Basically you have to put in the work in terms of building the pulling power and endurance everyday, through active recovery and also sprinting it. 
- but then I also need to train legs that part also need. 
- basically swimming la. 
- increase blood flow to simultaneously bring oxygen-rich blood to tissues and remove the cellular waste produced during exercise 
- promote delivering nutrients to your muscles so that they can recover and heal at a faster rate than if you were sitting on the couch.

I think when you are in the right environemnt that will stimulate you to start doing the thing that everyone around you is also doing. For example library.
